Building
========

Detailed building instructions are available at:

  http://ogdi.sourceforge.net/build.html

Unix
----

1) Set TOPDIR to point to the home directory of the OGDI source tree. 

   eg. 
   TOPDIR=/usr/ogdi-3.1.3
   export TOPDIR

2) Run configure.

   eg. 
   ./configure

3) Build with make (GNUmake is required). 

   make

   NOTE: on some platforms you will need to add the shared libraries to
   your LD_LIBRARY_PATH for the link phase to complete.  
 
   eg. 

   LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$TOPDIR/bin/Linux
   export LD_LIBRARY_PATH

4) Install.

   make install

Windows
-------

Windows works similarly, but a preset configuration is used instead of
building one with configure.

Requirements:
  o Cygwin (build shell) from http://www.cygwin.com/
  o Microsoft Visual C++ 6.x (make sure it works at the commandline from bash).

1) Set TOPDIR to point to the home directory of the OGDI source tree. 

   eg. 
   TOPDIR=c:/ogdi-3.1.3
   export TOPDIR

2) Set the target build configuration

   eg.
   TARGET=win32
   export TARGET

3) Build with make.

   make


Running
=======

Briefly, ensure that $TOPDIR/bin/$TARGET is in the path.  Ensure that
$TOPDIR/bin/$TARGET is in the LD_LIBRARY_PATH on Unix. 

To use in local mode try a command like:

 ogdi_info -u gltp:/dted/d:/toronto/dted -f Matrix -l 'DTED(DISK)' -dl

To use via the server, run gltpd.exe first in the background.  On windows, run 
portmap.exe before running gltpd.exe.  Then use a command like:

 ogdi_info -u gltp://localhost/dted/d:/toronto/dted -f Matrix -l 'DTED(DISK)' -dl
