Building
--------

Detailed building instructions are available at:

  http://ogdi.sourceforge.net/build.html

Briefly, set the environment variables TOPDIR (to point to home directory
of the OGDI source tree) and TARGET (to one of win32, linux or solaris - case 
matters).  $TOPDIR/bin/$TARGET must be in the LD_LIBRARY_PATH.  Then type make
in the root directory of the distribution (this directory).  

On windows the Cygwin environment (http://www.cygwin.com) is required. 


Running
-------

Briefly, ensure that $TOPDIR/bin/$TARGET is in the path.  Ensure that
$TOPDIR/bin/$TARGET is in the LD_LIBRARY_PATH on Unix. 

To use in local mode try a command like:

 ogdi_info -u gltp:/dted/d:/toronto/dted -f Matrix -l 'DTED(DISK)' -dl

To use via the server, run gltpd.exe first in the background.  On windows, run 
portmap.exe before running gltpd.exe.  Then use a command like:

 ogdi_info -u gltp://localhost/dted/d:/toronto/dted -f Matrix -l 'DTED(DISK)' -dl
