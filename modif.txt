Remarks:  -The function svr_BroadCloseLayers() in server.c seems to be useless and 
           it contains the following errors:
              The argument to ecs_OpenDynamicLib should be "ogdi" instead of "ecs".
              The argument passed to ecs_CloseDynamicLib() should be "handle" instead of "func".
              Also, this function does nat have to load the cln_BroadCloseLayer because both
              svr_BroadCloseLayers() and cln_BroadCloseLayers() are in the same library.
          -The function cln_BroadCloseLayers() in client.c seems to be useless.
          -To conclude, I suggest to remove svr_BroadCloseLayers() and cln_BroadCloseLayers() from the core.

          -Both example1 and example2 directories contain example1.c and the makefile to build this example.
           To correct the error, I took the makefile and the example2.c file from the previous core and I copied
           them in the example2 directory of the present core.

	    -The file datadict.h was missing to build the skeleton driver.  I took the one from the previous core.
